# Challenge 02: Portfolio Page

## Description
This is my portfolio page which potential employers will refer to in order to learn about me and my work. I hope to improve the aesthetics of my page as I learn new skills and gain confidence in my newly learned abilities. In the coming weeks and months I intend to add many more projects to this page.
